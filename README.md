Animal Detection for Crop Protection is an intelligent AI-based surveillance system designed to monitor agricultural fields and automatically detect the presence of potentially harmful animals using real-time image or video analysis. In many rural and forest-adjacent farming regions, wild animals such as elephants, wild boars, and deer often invade farmlands, leading to significant crop damage and economic loss. Traditional monitoring methods—such as fencing, human patrols, or scare tactics—are either ineffective or costly. This project addresses the problem using modern computer vision techniques. At the core of the system is a YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) deep learning model, trained on a dataset of labeled animal images. The model is capable of recognizing multiple animal classes, including elephants, cows, buffaloes, goats, deer, sheep, bears, and wild boars. By analyzing either uploaded images or live webcam feeds, the model can accurately detect and localize animals using bounding boxes and confidence scores. The detection result is then displayed to the user through a simple, interactive interface built using Streamlit. If an animal is identified in the frame, a warning message such as "Animal detected in the farm" is shown, prompting immediate attention. Otherwise, the system confirms the area as clear. This solution not only reduces manual effort and improves farm safety but also provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to conventional wildlife management methods. In the future, this system can be integrated with IoT devices to automate alerts via SMS or sirens, or be deployed on edge devices like Raspberry Pi for field use, making it a powerful tool for precision agriculture and rural safety.
